The data used to construct the charts above was sourced from [CDC - Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts by Sex, Age, and State](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku).

## Summary

The purpose of this post is not to advocate any particular position on Covid 19, but to illustrate the effective use of visualizations. The bar chart is perhaps the simplest form of visualization that can be made. Despite its simplicity, I feel that the bar chart is quite impactful. Anecdotal stories on cable news have their place, but so do the underlying statistical data.

## Questions

Here are a couple things to think about

- What is causing the deaths not due to Covid?
- Where is the press coverage and public outrage for these other causes of death?
- Should schools open this fall?
- Has the Covid 19 pandemic been sensationalized by media?
- Is the risk of Covid 19 to young people low?

## In Closing

I encourage individuals to supplement cable news, social media, and politics with as much data as they can find.
